# P4wnP1-A.L.O.A---RPiZeroW---BadUSB-Speaker
This project transforms a standard USB speaker into a powerful BadUSB device using a Raspberry Pi Zero W running P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. (A Little Offensive Appliance). While presented here in a speaker form factor, the core principles can be applied to other USB devices, including a standard USB stick, keyboard, or controller.
